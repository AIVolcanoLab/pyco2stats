Welcome to pyco2stats.
PyCO2stats is a free open source Python library desinged to perform
classic and robust statistical methods for CO2 flux and geochemical data
analysis.

PyCO2stats bridges the gap between advanced data science techniques and the specific requirements
of geochemical datasets regarding CO2 fluxes. PyCO2stats is designed to grant the maximum flexibility possible, enabling the user to perform a vast range of analyses, from classical statistical methods (such as mean, standard deviation etc...) to more complete and complex analyses, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or lognormal statistics for reduced population sizes. Moreover PyCO2stats meets the requirements in term for transparency and reproducibility, meeting so the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) and OpenScience standards. Laslty, PyCO2stats is suited for used either by Python expert users or by more novice users.
