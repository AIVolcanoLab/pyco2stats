Introduction and Citation
=========================


Welcome to pyco2stats.
PyCO2stats is a free open source Python library desinged to perform
classic and robust statistical methods for CO2 flux and geochemical data
analysis.

Orange-Volcanoes bridges the gap between advanced data science techniques and the specific requirements
of geochemical datasets. It uses Orange's powerful interactive environment to apply machine learning,
statistical modelling, and explainable AI methods to petrological datasets. Users can easily build
customized workflows by linking widgets, facilitating rapid iteration and discovery in magmatic and
volcanic research.

Whether you are conducting large-scale geochemical studies, refining glass and mineral chemical datasets,
or testing magmatic equilibria, Orange-Volcanoes offers an intuitive and flexible tool to enhance your
analytical capabilities. This documentation will guide you through each widget and its applications,
providing the basis for an in-depth study of volcanic and petrological processes.
